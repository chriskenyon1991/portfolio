            I'm new to the software development industry and I am eager to learn
            as much as possible. I decided to make the change into coding because
            I love pushing myself and learning new skills.

            For the past 5 years I have been a HGV driver delvering goods across

            with customers and employers to ensure that everthing ran
            smoothly.

            In my spare time I am currently working on a database for the card

            player keep track of them.

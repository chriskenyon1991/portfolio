            I have been in the software development world for little over a year
            now and I am still finding new and interesting ways of solving
            problems. I find the more that I learn about coding the more
            passionate I get about it.

          <h3>Northcoders</h3>
          <h6>full-stack bootcamp</h6>
          <p>
            Northcoders kicked off my coding journey by teaching me full-stack
            development. The course was taught mainly in JavaScript, we was also
            taught the industries best practices such as paired programming, TTD
            and how to use of github.

          <p>
            Before making the desicion to change career into coding I was a
            lorry driver I had been delvering goods across the UK for the past 5
            years. In this role I had to ensure the deliveries were made on time
            and because of this I have learned a great deal about communication
            with customers and employers to ensure that everthing ran smoothly.

          <h3>Peak Investing</h3>
          <h6>finTech - react-native developer</h6>
          <p>
            I have spent the last year working for a fintech start-up called
            Peak Investing. Here I was responsible for building the mobile app
            in React Native. Working here I have had to contribute the decisions
            regarding the coding, such as which back-end to use and which API
            for the stock data. This has allowed me to grow and become a
            stronger Developer. Previous to this, I studied at ‘Northcoders’
            learning full-stack development in JavaScript. I’m thoroughly
            enjoying learning new languages, libraries and frame works, and
            would relish the opportunity to be able to continue to learn and
            grow in my new career.
